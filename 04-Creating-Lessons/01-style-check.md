# The Style Check

Before your first lesson, we'll help walk you through the setup process. We'll 
need two things from you:

1. A code diff showing the before/after state of your first lesson
2. A 30-second recording of chunk of your first lesson

## The Code
The code diff will help us dial in the scope of your first lesson. Most new
instructors are a bit too ambitious with their first lesson and try to teach
way too much. We'll help you scale it back to something that stays focused 
and follows the bite-sized guidelines.

## The Video
The 30-second style check will help lock-in the requirements around teaching
style, dimensions, font sizes, contrast, etc. 30 seconds is the limit because
it helps us get feedback to you sooner and avoids major re-recording of lessons.
A side benefit of this approach is to help you learn how to record in "chunks"
of 30 seconds which make lessons much easier to edit and manage later on.

## The Feedback
Nobody makes a perfect first lesson. So please upload the style check to our
Slack channel and we'll walk you through how to improve. Please ask any
questions that come to mind or difficulty you may have experienced. There is
_A LOT_ of collective experience recording and teaching in the egghead.io Slack,
please take advantage of it :)
