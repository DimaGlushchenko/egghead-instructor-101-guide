# Thinking About Lesson Titles
The first challenge for any bite-sized lesson is coming up with a topic. If you feel stuck, here a few things to think about:

Is there a new library or utility that's piqued your interest? Did you finally solve that head-scratching (or keyboard-smashing) problem? Maybe you've seen something useful on StackOverflow?

It is essential that you understand what you are about to teach. 

**Giving your lesson a solid title and summary before you hit record makes your life much easier,** and in turn makes your content more useful and meaningful to the thousands of developers who will watch it.

Let's walk through an example of the thought process behind a lesson title and summary:

â€œI've been working with React a lot lately. Something interesting about React components are their lifecycle methods that each fire at particular times."

You might quickly think of something like this for a title:


> React Component Lifecycle Methods

This is a tempting title!

It's too broad for a bite-sized lesson. Let's think about it a bit more and see about narrowing the topic down:

"Reading about lifecycle methods in the React docs, I've noticed that `componentWillReceiveProps` isn't as clear as some of the others."

Now we have a target! Continuing to drill down on `componentWillReceiveProps`, we can write a quick summary of what the viewer can expect:


> In this lesson you will learn how to dynamically update a React component's state based on the properties that are passed into it. We will take a look at the React component `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method, and how to use it effectively.

Here's a trick to coming up with a good title: In your head say "How do I...", and then summarize your summary. 

You wouldn't say "How do I... React Component Lifecycle Methods: componentWillReceiveProps", but instead something like "How do I... Use componentWillReceiveProps to Manage React Component State".


>  Use componentWillReceiveProps to Manage React Component State

This title and summary read well, and **give a viewer a good idea of what to expect from the lesson**. People watch screencasts to *solve specific problems and learn specific things*, and good descriptions help them find the answers you provide.
