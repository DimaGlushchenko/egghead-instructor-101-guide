## **Greetings and salutations!**

*egghead lessons are concise*. Generally speaking, people are going to watch more than one lesson. Greeting them and wishing them farewell is not adding anything to their experience.

Please don't greet the student, introduce yourself, talk about past lessons, talk about future lessons, plug your podcast, or anything that isn't core to the lesson.

Just start doing. Start showing. You can recap the lesson at the end if you like, but keep it short and just nail the key points and then just stop! Make them yearn for more.

## **Time and space.**

Now. Stay in it.

As much as possible try to avoid referencing other lessons. "In the next lesson..." or "In the previous lesson..." should be avoided. An egghead.io lesson should be as self-contained as possible, teaching a concept. The lesson will be surrounded by context in the form of a list of related lessons, a title, a text description with helpful links.

If you do need to reference a prerequisite lesson, link to it in the description!
