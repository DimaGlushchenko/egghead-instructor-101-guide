# egghead Slack Channels
There are several channels that we use to communicate within the egghead.io Slack. Several of them are specific to instructors and lesson creation, and there are a few that are just for fun. As with any Slack group, direct messages are a great way to keep in touch with other members of the community.

## Your private instructor channel

All new instructors will start out with a private conversation with the egghead.io team to help get your first lesson published. This is where you can freely ask any questions you might have and brainstorm ideas for your first lessons and courses. We are here to help you succeed!

## #egghead-chat

This is the "water cooler" channel, where basically anything goes (within the [general code of conduct](), or course). Many egghead instructors are freelancers or work at home, so this gives us a place to socialize and talk about programming and industry stuff. It is noisy, so many people choose to turn off notifications for this room.

## #egghead-instructors

This room is meant to discuss the craft and act of creating **bite-sized code videos**. It's a great place to solicit feedback from other instructors and the egghead.io team about your latest lesson ideas, course proposals, or drafts. We've got an amazing group of experienced instructors that are happy to help you. We recommend using that to your full advantage. We've done a lot of this, so there is no reason to struggle alone.

## #egghead-publishing-queue

This is a channel where lesson publishing activity is announced by bots. When a lesson is uploaded, or a course/lesson is published, it is announced in this channel automatically. 

## #egghead-lesson-ideas

There are so many things to teach about in the world of web development. When we see something interesting or get a request, it gets dropped in here. If you can't think of anything to record a lesson about, ask in here with `@joel` . Thereâ€™s always something to teach ðŸ™‚!

We've got other channels for specific topics like music & tv, fitness, functional programming, and podcasts. Like most Slack groups, members are free to make public and private channels, add emoji, and even integrations. Use your good judgement, and if you have any questions please feel free to ask. That's what we're here for!
