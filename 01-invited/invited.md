# You'e invited to teach on egghead.io

Congrats! :tada:

We are excited to work with you and help teach people how to become better programmers.

There are a few things that we want to let you know to get started. You aren't on your own, we are here to help as much as possible. To be your concierge, and eliminate as much pain as possible from the process of creating awesome bite-sized video tutorials on egghead.io.

You should have received two things. An invitation to the egghead Slack chat, and a link to set up your instructor profile on egghead.io. If you haven't received either of those, be sure to contact whoever invited you and ask them "what's up?"

It is likely that the person that invited you to teach on egghead.io will also be your **mentor** and primary point of contact as you work towards getting your first lessons and courses published.

## Your Mentor

egghead.io doesn't have an open call for submissions for lessons. This means that you were invited by somebody to create a lesson. The person that invited you is **your mentor** (or will introduce you to your mentor)

## Instructor Profile

Your invitation link should take you to the form so that you can create an instructor profile and an egghead.io account if you don't have one. 

Creating your instructor profile will give you **lifetime access to egghead.io free of charge**.

Your instructor profile is not public until you've published your first lesson. 

## Slack Channel

We love Slack, and our channel is an amazing mix of developers from around the globe. It is open to egghead instructors and people working on getting lessons published on egghead.

There are several chats available. We're just going to talk about a few real quick so that you can get your bearings when you land!

### egghead-chat

This is the "watercooler" and general discussion area. When you enter the chat for the first time, please introduce yourself and maybe provide a link to something that you work on or the spot where you blog on the internet.

The general chat can be a little noisey, so you might want to adjust your notification and do-not-distrub settings in Slack to match your preferences. 

The general chat is free to discuss anything you are interested in. We've got a [code of conduct]() that we ask all participants in the Slack channel to respect.

> **TODO** code of conduct for slack

### egghead-instructors

This room is meant to discuss the craft and act of creating **bite-sized code videos**. When an instructor uploads a new lesson, it is announced in this chat.

### egghead-lesson-ideas

There are so many things to teach about in the world of web development. When we see something interesting or get a request, it gets dropped in here. If you can't think of anything to record a lesson about, ask in here with `@joel`. I've almost always got something :simple_smile:!
