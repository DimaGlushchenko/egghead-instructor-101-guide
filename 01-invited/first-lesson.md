## Your First Lesson Video

Making *anything* is an accomplishment. Creating screencasts is hard. It's a learned skill. It can feel weird. You can get the feeling of stage fright sitting in the comfort of your own home office staring at your monitor with nobody else in the room.

Totally normal!

It also (thankfully) fades over time as you learn the skill of creating bite-sized video lessons.

For an draft lesson, we aren't looking for polish. We want to see something quick and rough. Outside of picking a topic

### How rough is too rough?

haha, Kevin Rose tossing this racoon is definitely **too rough**. :flushed:

Varmint tossing aside, your draft lesson should take less than a half an hour to produce. Pick something you've been learning or working on recently and show it to us. Pretend that you are sitting next to a coworker, and want to show them a cool new piece of technology that you just learned.

Would you make them a Power Point presentation?

Would you read from a script?

Or would you just sit down, fire up a browser and your favorite text editor and actually **show them what you've built**, and why it is interesting?

That's what we are looking for with an draft lesson. Show us something cool. Make it one thing. Assume we are smart and have the prerequisites covered. Don't worry about leaving us hanging. We don't need to know everything, yet.

For now, don't worry about audio or video quality. We will send you professional audio recording gear and explain the technical details about recording screencasts later on.

### One step closer!

Once your draft has been submitted, it will be reviewed. You will receive feedback, that you can use to start crafting your first lesson for publication. 

You should create your egghead.io Instructor Profile. You can do this by requesting an invite link from your mentor. Please be sure to fill out all of the details. Your profile will remain hidden until your first lesson is published.

You should also have an invite to the egghead Slack chat. This is where we communicate as a group. Your mentor is there, as well as all of the other egghead.io instructors.

Now we will take that rough knowledge nugget that is your draft lesson, and polish it into an egghead gem!
