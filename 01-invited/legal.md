# Contracts and Payment

We've got a [standard contributor agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jNT6R6SNb9OVYSnpTDqevMh80XZ8Gu3VeYoLZck0v4/edit?usp=sharing) that we supply to all instructors. The goal of the agreement is protect egghead from any mischief you might cause, leave **all rights** to you the creator, and lay out the terms for payment.

We use DocuSign for electronic signatures for these agreements. When the time comes, the agreement will be delivered to your email address for your signature.

## Getting Paid

egghead.io instructors receive royalties for their lessons. :moneybag:

Royalties are paid at the beginning of the month, and reflect how many 30 second segments **subscribers** watched of your lessons in the previous month. We use paypal or direct deposit to distribute royalties.

The amount you are paid depends on the overall gross subscription revenue, and how many 30 second segments were watched in total. 

``` ruby
egghead_monthly_revenue * ( your_segments / total_segments ) * royalty_percent
```

This is the basic algorithm.

It can range from "lunch money" to "paying the bills!", and varies mostly based on your catalog of lessons. Producing courses takes the most effort, but they also make the most money for instructors. 

In general we favor the approach of making interesting and useful content versus min/maxxing the numbers to squeeze the most dollars out of the content. We don't produce sponsored content or run ads on a regular basis.
