# Contracts

We've got a [standard contributor agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jNT6R6SNb9OVYSnpTDqevMh80XZ8Gu3VeYoLZck0v4/edit?usp=sharing) that we supply to all instructors. The goal of the agreement is protect egghead from any mischief you might cause, leave **all ownership rights** to you the creator, and lay out the terms for payment.

We use DocuSign for electronic signatures for these agreements. When the time comes, the agreement will be delivered to your email address for your signature.
