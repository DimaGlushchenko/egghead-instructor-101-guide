## Lesson Recording Quickstart

We will go into detail about all of the aspects of creating bite-sized lessons for programmers, but let's start out with the bare essentials to get you started recording right now.

### Technical Specs

* 1280x720 \(720p\)
* 16:9 Aspect Ratio
* Stereo audio

### Screen Layout

It's important to give the person learning easy access to what we are trying to teach. Since we are using video, we want the text to be as clear and legible as possible. People will watch these lessons on large monitors, as well as small portable screens.

A typical lesson will have the **code on the left** filling 2\/3rds of the screen. Notice that the code's font size has been increased to **maximize the space** available.

The **example will be on the right**, and occupies 1\/3rd of the screen. This is something to consider when you are creating examples, as they will have to fit into that space.

The most important thing to consider is **why the user is watching the lesson**. Generally, it is so they can learn about some tool or feature. They _need_ to **see the code**!

The code needs to be comfortable.

Now that the screen is ready to record, we will look at how to do that on your platform.

### If you're on a Mac...

[ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) provides basic capture and editing on the Mac. Grab the demo version, and we will supply a license.

Here's a demo from egghead instructor Trevor D. Miller showing how he uses ScreenFlow:
