# The Lesson Idea

> I can't think of anything to record! :cry:

This is normal! It's like writer's block. You are staring at a blank canvas of infinite possibilities. We need to take that first stroke and get the ball rolling. In many ways, you can look at a screencast lesson as a blog post or short article.

It's also totally possible that looking at it like a blog post or short article won't help at all!

So let's take a look at what an "idea" is, and what we need to conjure up to create an awesome lesson on egghead.io

## What makes a great idea?

Well, first off, we are looking for **practical** lessons that help people perform real work. We want to ensure that we are respecting their time, and providing an answer to something specific in a concise way.

Two things that very cleary let us know the strength of a lesson, before anything has even been recorded are:

* The title
* The summary

### A strong title is key!

The first thing you need to do is consider the topic that you want to teach. It's important to keep in mind what an egghead lesson is.

Concise.

We strive to teach on thing very clearly in a short amount of time.

#### How do I...?

A great trick to creating a strong title is to say "How do I...?" in your head and then write the title.

[how do I...] Debug Angular Applications with Chrome DevTools

This clearly defines the scope of the lesson, and also informs the student as to what they will be watching. If you consider google and StackOverflow (and you should!), this is how people use those tools. We type keywords related to some "how do I...?" question into Google, and (hopefully) find elightenment with the results. 

You definitely want your lesson to show up in the results!

### Clearly summarize the lessons

Now that you've got a great title, you need to write a clear concise summary describing:

* the problem/pain we will solve
* how we will solve it

You are giving away the ending in the summary! It **should** be a spoiler that explains what we are about to learn. If it is too long or requires a lot of detail to summarize coherently, perhaps the lesson scope needs to be reduced.

## How short should my lessons be?

When we talk about "bite-sized" lessons, we don't mean strictly length. Some topics require some extra time to clearly explain. We aren't aiming for a specific duration target.

The goal with an egghead lesson is to clearly present a concept.

Be concise. Remove cruft.

Single purpose lessons with no distractions.

We've found that most things can be explained in under 10 minutes.

### "10 minutes?!? Monads will take me days to explain!"

Complex topics are generally composed of many smaller solutions/concepts. We break a thing down into small atoms of information, combining them to create something more than the sum of its parts.

For some topics, it is hard to explain them without the context of a course. We will talk about that later, as it is vital and important. We combine bite-sized lessons together to make bite-sized courses. Some egghead courses are only 10 minutes long, but convery a ton of information.

If you're recording a stand-alone lesson, find the core concept and stick to it.

## Is this already covered on egghead.io?

Here's a secret... it doesn't matter if it is already covered on egghead.io. It is **very likely** that your persective will be interesting and will serve to help somebody. "egghead sure has too many awesome videos on doing ___________. What's up with that?" <- this is not something we are too worried about hearing!

## I'm just learning!

This is fantastic. It is impossible to regain the "true beginner" perspective. Once you've seen the answer, it can't be unseen. Taking what you are learning it and turning it into lessons for others will save them time and provide immense value.

What **you** are learning is what you should be teaching. That's what we want to hear about.

There are no bad topics.

*There are no topics that are too simple.*
