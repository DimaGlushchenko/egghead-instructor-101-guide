# The Lesson Idea

> I can't think of anything to record! :cry:

This is normal! It's like writer's block. You are staring at a blank canvas of infinite possibilities. We need to take that first stroke and get the ball rolling. In many ways, you can look at a screencast lesson as a blog post or short article.

It's also totally possible that looking at it like a blog post or short article won't help at all!

So let's take a look at what an "idea" is, and what we need to conjure up to create an awesome lesson on egghead.io

## What makes a great idea?

Well, first off, we are looking for **practical** lessons that help people perform real work. We want to ensure that we are respecting their time, and providing an answer to something specific in a concise way.

## Is this already covered on egghead.io?

Here's a secret... it doesn't matter if it is already covered on egghead.io. It is **very likely** that your persective will be interesting and will serve to help somebody. "egghead sure has too many awesome videos on doing ___________. What's up with that?" <- this is not something we are too worried about hearing!

## I'm just learning!

This is fantastic. It is impossible to regain the "true beginner" perspective. Once you've seen the answer, it can't be unseen. Taking what you are learning it and turning it into lessons for others will save them time and provide immense value.

What **you** are learning is what you should be teaching. That's what we want to hear about.

There are no bad topics.

*There are no topics that are too simple.*
