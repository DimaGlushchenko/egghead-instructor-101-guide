# You're an expert.

We want to help people build better software and level-up there careers as developers. We don't like long draw out lectures. We prefer to show instead of tell. We want to see the code, and not a slide show of bullet points.

An egghead lesson respects the time of the person trying to learn something new. We are busy professionals, with a small amount of time to devote to the continued education required in the field of software development.

Our mission is to make programmers **badass**. :punch:

An egghead instructor is a working professional that builds software for a living. We aren't "embroidered polo shirt" trainers that spend more time teaching than doing.

We code.

We have users.

We understand what it takes to ship software.
