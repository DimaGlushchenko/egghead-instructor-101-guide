                        <h2 id="the-example">The example.</h2>
<p>We are going to start with the example. The example is important, because it is the basis of creating a quality egghead lesson. The example will take the tool or technique you want to demonstrate, and inform the best way to get there.</p>
<p>You will work with your mentor to solidify the theme, scope, and goals of an example. This example will serve as the basis for your first egghead lesson.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h3>
<p>We need a theme. We need a pain. Some useful concept we can share with other developers. Think of this like &quot;hey, check this out&quot; to a friend or coworker about some tool, trick, or technique you&apos;ve used to get the job done.</p>
<p>This is the gold! &#x1F4B0;</p>
<p>Ask your mentor and read <a href="../02-creating-lessons/ideas.html">this section</a> about figuring out the core concept for your first example.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-stop">Where to stop?</h3>
<p>On the other side of the coin, we need to determine where to stop! Knowing where to stop is determined by the scope of the lesson you are trying to teach.</p>
<p>At egghead, we strive for <em>laser focus</em> on concepts. This is what is meant when we say &quot;bite-sized&quot; lessons. We want individual lessons to be as concise and as focused as possible, while showing the viewer all of the steps required.</p>
<p>This means that you should be practical and thorough, respecting the viewers time, as well as your own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Is this more than one concept or idea?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask this question and discuss it with your mentor.</p>
<h3 id="iterate-on-the-example">Iterate on the example</h3>
<p>Most examples should work in a tool like <a href="https://plnkr.co/" target="_blank">Plunkr</a>, our preferred tool for iterating on the first example. If the requirements of your topic are more complex we should discuss the scope and goals of the example and determine if we can simplify it. If it just can&apos;t be done on Plunkr, a Github repository will be used.</p>
<p>We will keep it simple! There is a reason the TODO list is such a popular example. It is &quot;lame&quot; and you might be bored of it, but simple examples (especially more common examples) are excellent for teaching. The more complex the example application, the more nuanced the <strong>domain concerns</strong> and the more time we have to spend covering that.</p>
<p>If we work towards simplicity, and not put too much effort into creating a novel and fun example, we actually do a service for our viewers by maximising their learning efforts. We focus them on the concept we want them to learn, and more effectively cement it in their brain.</p>
<p><strong>Small, high quality examples, in great frequency.</strong></p>
<p>This is what we are striving for at egghead.</p>
<p>Take notes as you build the example, and get a rough working draft of the code and concept as quickly as possible. We are striving for &quot;it works&quot; so that you can share and get feedback from your mentor as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Once you&apos;ve got the draft done, share it over screen sharing technology with your mentor. Walk them through the steps it took to create the example. You should listen to your mentor&apos;s questions and take notes where appropriate.</p>
<p>This will be a great time to brainstorm for ideas, and discuss more lessons that could be created with your example.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t be surprised if the scope of your example is cut back. Knowing what to leave out is a challenge, and we will aggressively work towards that conciseness that we crave at egghead. The lesson should cover one topic, and one topic only. No more, no less.</p>
<h3 id="choose-a-title-and-write-a-summary"><strong>Choose a title and write a summary</strong></h3>
<p>Now that the example is in a good state, it&apos;s time to choose a title. Here&apos;s a formula for writing good titles.</p>
<p>In your head (or out loud. Go nuts!) say the phrase &quot;How do I...&quot;</p>
<p><em>Update ref attributes.</em></p>
<p>And then add the appropriate technology to the end such as &quot;in React component.&quot; So &quot;how do I...&quot;</p>
<p><em>Update ref attributes in React components</em> becomes the title of the lesson. This focuses the action on what the viewer should learn, and the title clearly defines the scope for the example you will teach. &quot;I want to...&quot;, &quot;can I...&quot;, or other phrases would work here too!</p>
<p>Now you want to write a quick summary. Think of the short block of text you see under a link when you are searching on Google. Literally think of that exact box, because the summary is for that space! 2-3 sentences that describe what we will learn in your lesson.</p>
<p>The summary and title aren&apos;t set in stone, we can iterate on those too, so don&apos;t worry. We aren&apos;t striving for perfection.</p>
<h2 id="your-first-lesson-video">Your First Lesson Video</h2>
<p>Making <em>anything</em> is an accomplishment. Creating screencasts is hard. It&apos;s a learned skill. It can feel weird. You can get the feeling of stage fright sitting in the comfort of your own home office staring at your monitor with nobody else in the room.</p>
<p>Totally normal!</p>
<p>It also (thankfully) fades over time as you learn the skill of creating bite-sized video lessons.</p>
<p>For a draft lesson, we aren&apos;t looking for polish. We want to see something quick and rough.</p>
<h3 id="a-very-rough-draft">A very rough draft.</h3>
<p>Imagine that you are sitting next to a coworker, and want to show them a cool new piece of technology that you just learned.</p>
<p>Would you make them a Power Point presentation?</p>
<p>Would you read from a script?</p>
<p>Or would you just sit down, fire up a browser and your favorite text editor and actually <strong>show them what you&apos;ve built</strong>, and why it is interesting?</p>
<p>That&apos;s what we are looking for with an draft lesson. You&apos;ve built a cool example, let&apos;s take a look at it. Tell us how you built it, and what makes it interesting.</p>
<p>For now, don&apos;t worry about audio or video quality. We will send you professional audio recording gear and explain the technical details about recording screencasts later on.</p>
<p>Make mistakes! This might be new, and screencasting is most certainly a learned skill that gets easier with practice. This isn&apos;t a live presentation, and this draft won&apos;t be shared with the world.</p>
<p>Mistakes are fine. We will need to restart, cough, kids will run through, train will roll by, you name it, it happens to everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Just pause.</strong></p>
<p>Pause, and repeat where you were interrupted. Pauses are SO easy to edit out, and you should feel free to use them. <strong>Pause a lot.</strong>. Take a deep breath. Speak with confidence! You <em>are</em> the expert.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to hear what you have to say.</p>
<h3 id="upload-your-lesson">Upload Your Lesson</h3>
<p>Now that the draft is complete, share it with your mentor using Slack. Ask your mentor to screen share with you for the editing process, so that you can get some guidance as needed for the first pass. This can save <strong>hours</strong> trying to figure things out.</p>
<p>Your mentor knows what we are looking for!</p>
