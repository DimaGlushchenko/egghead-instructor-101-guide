<p>We want to help people build better software and level-up there careers as developers. We don&apos;t like long draw out lectures. We prefer to show instead of tell. We want to see the code, and not a slide show of bullet points.</p>
<p>An egghead lesson respects the time of the person trying to learn something new. We are busy professionals, with a small amount of time to devote to the continued education required in the field of software development.</p>
<p>Our mission is to make programmers <strong>badass</strong>.</p>
<p>An egghead instructor is a working professional that builds software for a living. We aren&apos;t &quot;embroidered polo shirt&quot; trainers that spend more time teaching than doing.</p>
<p>We code.</p>
<p>We have users.</p>
<p>We understand what it takes to ship software.</p>
<h2 id="so-youve-been-invited-to-teach-on-eggheadio">So you&apos;ve been invited to teach on egghead.io?</h2>
<h3 id="your-mentor">Your Mentor</h3>
<p>egghead.io doesn&apos;t have an open call for submissions for lessons. This means that you were invited by somebody to create a lesson. The person that invited you is <strong>your mentor</strong> (or will introduce you to your mentor)</p>
<h3 id="the-audition">The Audition</h3>
<p>Making <em>anything</em> is an accomplishment. Creating screencasts is hard. It&apos;s a learned skill. It can feel weird. You can get the feeling of stage fright sitting in the comfort of your own home office staring at your monitor with nobody else in the room.</p>
<p>Totally normal!</p>
<p>It also (thankfully) fades over time as you learn the skill of creating bite-sized video lessons.</p>
<p>For an audition, we aren&apos;t looking for polish. We want to see something quick and rough. Outside of picking a topic</p>
<h4 id="how-rough-is-too-rough">How rough is too rough?</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3f3S3i283y10182z3b/Image%202016-04-19%20at%2012.11.49%20PM.gif?v=28a2210d" alt=""></p>
<p>haha, Kevin Rose tossing this raccoon is definitely <strong>too rough</strong>.</p>
<p>Varmint tossing aside, your audition should take less than a half an hour to produce. Pick something you&apos;ve been learning or working on recently and show it to us. Pretend that you are sitting next to a coworker, and want to show them a cool new piece of technology that you just learned.</p>
<p>Would you make them a Power Point presentation?</p>
<p>Would you read from a script?</p>
<p>Or would you just sit down, fire up a browser and your favorite text editor and actually <strong>show them what you&apos;ve built</strong>, and why it is interesting?</p>
<p>That&apos;s what we are looking for with an audition. Show us something cool. Make it one thing. Assume we are smart and have the prerequisites covered. Don&apos;t worry about leaving us hanging. We don&apos;t need to know everything, yet.</p>
