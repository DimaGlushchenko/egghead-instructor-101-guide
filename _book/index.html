<p>We want to help people build better software and level-up there careers as developers. We don&apos;t like long draw out lectures. We prefer to show instead of tell. We want to see the code, and not a slide show of bullet points.</p>
<p>An egghead lesson respects the time of the person trying to learn something new. We are busy professionals, with a small amount of time to devote to the continued education required in the field of software development.</p>
<p>Our mission is to make programmers <strong>badass</strong>. <img align="absmiddle" alt=":punch:" class="emoji" src="gitbook/plugins/gitbook-plugin-advanced-emoji/emojis/punch.png" title=":punch:"></p>
<p>An egghead instructor is a working professional that builds software for a living. We aren&apos;t &quot;embroidered polo shirt&quot; trainers that spend more time teaching than doing.</p>
<p>We code.</p>
<p>We have users.</p>
<p>We understand what it takes to ship software.</p>
<h2 id="so-youve-been-invited-to-teach-on-eggheadio">So you&apos;ve been invited to teach on egghead.io?</h2>
<h3 id="your-mentor">Your Mentor</h3>
<p>egghead.io doesn&apos;t have an open call for submissions for lessons. This means that you were invited by somebody to create a lesson. The person that invited you is <strong>your mentor</strong> (or will introduce you to your mentor)</p>
<h3 id="the-audition">The Audition</h3>
<p>Making <em>anything</em> is an accomplishment. Creating screencasts is hard. It&apos;s a learned skill. It can feel weird. You can get the feeling of stage fright sitting in the comfort of your own home office staring at your monitor with nobody else in the room.</p>
<p>Totally normal!</p>
<p>It also (thankfully) fades over time as you learn the skill of creating bite-sized video lessons.</p>
<p>For an audition, we aren&apos;t looking for polish. We want to see something quick and rough. Outside of picking a topic</p>
<h4 id="how-rough-is-too-rough">How rough is too rough?</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1f3f3S3i283y10182z3b/Image%202016-04-19%20at%2012.11.49%20PM.gif?v=28a2210d" alt=""></p>
<p>haha, Kevin Rose tossing this racoon is definitely <strong>too rough</strong>. <img align="absmiddle" alt=":flushed:" class="emoji" src="gitbook/plugins/gitbook-plugin-advanced-emoji/emojis/flushed.png" title=":flushed:"></p>
<p>Varmint tossing aside, your audition should take less than a half an hour to produce. Pick something you&apos;ve been learning or working on recently and show it to us. Pretend that you are sitting next to a coworker, and want to show them a cool new piece of technology that you just learned.</p>
<p>Would you make them a Power Point presentation?</p>
<p>Would you read from a script?</p>
<p>Or would you just sit down, fire up a browser and your favorite text editor and actually <strong>show them what you&apos;ve built</strong>, and why it is interesting?</p>
<p>That&apos;s what we are looking for with an audition. Show us something cool. Make it one thing. Assume we are smart and have the prerequisites covered. Don&apos;t worry about leaving us hanging. We don&apos;t need to know everything, yet.</p>
<p>For now, don&apos;t worry about audio or video quality. We will send you professional audio recording gear and explain the technical details about recording screencasts later on.</p>
<h4 id="one-step-closer">One step closer!</h4>
<p>Once your audition has been submitted, it will be reviewed. You will receive feedback, that you can use to start crafting your first lesson for publication. </p>
<p>You should create your egghead.io Instructor Profile. You can do this by requesting an invite link from your mentor. Please be sure to fill out all of the details. Your profile will remain hidden until your first lesson is published.</p>
<p>You should also have an invite to the egghead Slack chat. This is where we communicate as a group. Your mentor is there, as well as all of the other egghead.io instructors.</p>
<p>Now we will take that rough knowledge nugget that is your audition, and polish it into an egghead gem!</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-egghead-lesson">Creating an egghead lesson</h2>
<p>To get published, your lesson needs to be &quot;in the style of egghead.io&quot;. This is what we need to deconstruct so that we can understand exactly what that means.</p>
<p>To get started, we are going to sit down and watch some egghead lessons.</p>

<p><strong>TODO</strong> we need to make this list a lot smaller and go through each item individually and discuss <strong>why it is good</strong></p>

<h3 id="lesson-virtues">Lesson Virtues</h3>
<p>What makes a good lesson? We&apos;ve distilled it down into these **5 virtues of a badass egghead.io lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lesson Virtue #1</li>
<li>Lesson Virtue #2</li>
<li>Lesson Virtue #3</li>
<li>Lesson Virtue #4</li>
<li>Lesson Virtue #5</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lesson-virtue-1">Lesson Virtue #1</h4>
<p>In this section we will examine a lesson and talk about how it matches the lesson virtue.</p>
<h4 id="lesson-virtue-2">Lesson Virtue #2</h4>
<p>In this section we will examine a lesson and talk about how it matches the lesson virtue.</p>
<h4 id="lesson-virtue-3">Lesson Virtue #3</h4>

<h3 id="audio-equipment">Audio Equipment</h3>
<p>We want you to sound <strong>amazing</strong>! Because you are. </p>
<p>Once you&apos;ve created a draft lesson that is <em>almost</em> ready to be published, we will ship you a case stuffed full of audio recording toys that will have you sounding awesome in no time. </p>

<ul>
<li>High Quality Floor Microphone Boom</li>
<li>Shure BETA 87A Microphone</li>
<li>Shock Mount to attach the mic to the stand</li>
<li>TASCAM US-2x2 USB Audio Interface</li>
<li>1 XLR Cable to connect the Microphone to the USB Interface</li>
<li>Badass by Kathy Sierra</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup has 2 cables and a couple of knobs to get setup. We will go through each piece individually and discuss what it is and why it is in the box.</p>
<h4 id="microphone-boom">Microphone Boom</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2y322s3t1z1c1L1t0E1N/Image%202016-04-19%20at%203.09.21%20PM.jpg?v=25fc2bea" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a stand for the mic. They come in many shapes and sizes. This is a very nice one from Germany. It is sturdy and breaks down into 2 parts for easy storage in the box. It lets us pack everything we need into this case.</p>
<h4 id="the-microphone">The Microphone</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/1t090h1h0E471T2I0L21/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.40.22%20PM.jpg?v=b73c834d" alt=""></p>
<p>Obviously an important piece of equipment! The <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/beta/beta-87a-vocal-microphone" target="_blank">Shure BETA 87a mic</a> is a <code>supercardioid</code> mic, which refers to how it pics up sound. It is forgiving and doesn&apos;t pick up ambient noise. Mics are interesting because you can go <strong>very crazy</strong> in terms of cost for marginal returns. We aren&apos;t producing NPR segments, and this mic is definitely in the &quot;sounds very good&quot; column. :thumbs_up:</p>
<h4 id="shock-mount">Shock Mount</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3B1c3U2a3V0O183f0s1g/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.42.25%20PM.jpg?v=5cbc664a" alt=""></p>
<p>This little piece connects to the boom and the microphone slides into it before being attached to the XLR cable. It will dampen any footsteps or other vibrations that might be picked up through the stand to the mic.</p>
<h4 id="usb-audio-interface">USB Audio Interface</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3F0y1N3w2y3v0V1X1O3m/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.41.32%20PM.jpg?v=4441d0b4" alt=""></p>
<p>This mic is built for professional audio applications and not necessarily for capturing audio on a computer. To get from the mic to the computer we need an interface that will convert XLR analog signal into 1s and 0s for the computer to store. It has an XLR input (2 actually) and a USB output, from the mic and to the computer, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="xlr-cable">XLR Cable</h4>
<p>XLR is a type of plug that is used in professional audio applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2i393q1J0H0Y1O192Y1E/Image%202016-04-19%20at%201.38.59%20PM.jpg?v=0fed5337" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="creating-courses">Creating Courses</h2>
<p>Now that you&apos;ve had a lesson or two published, you might be thinking &quot;I really want to create a course!&quot;</p>
<p>This is great, and we are going to help you do just that.</p>
<h3 id="course-ideas">Course Ideas</h3>
<p>We want to provide some &quot;food for thought&quot; around what makes an interesting course. </p>
<h3 id="course-planning">Course Planning</h3>
<p>A course is coupled with a written proposal in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1goXtI_zmSfXTgaimrxIss356DoedPRt5MMAySs1f-bE/edit" target="_blank">this format</a>.</p>
<p>The course proposal should have a &quot;user story&quot; sentence that describes who the user is, what they want to learn, and why they want to learn it.</p>
<p>It should have a &quot;goals&quot; section that clearly defines the learning objectives for the course.</p>
<p>It should have a summary that describes in narrative form what it is we will be learning. </p>
<p>It should have a list of lesson titles and short summaries for the proposed lessons. Titles should be descriptive and contain the key words for the lesson topic. Often using &quot;how do I&quot; in front of the title helps here.</p>
<h3 id="creating-examples">Creating Examples</h3>
<p>Good lessons have good examples. We want to show the user a series of small, high-quality examples that serve the goal of the course. We are all here for the code, so lets deliver.</p>
