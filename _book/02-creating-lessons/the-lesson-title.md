# The Lesson Title

The lesson title is immensely important. It is the first thing the user is likely to see to describe what the lesson is about. It contains the primary key words that the user will use to discover the lesson via Google or egghead's site search. Consider the following titles:

> ## Method Chaining

> ## Using Ramda's Pipe to Chain Methods

Both of these titles describe what we are going to do, but one is more specific and informs us what we will accomplish.

## The "how do I..." format

In your head \(or out loud. Go nuts!\) say the phrase "How do I..."

> _**Update ref attributes.**_

And then add the appropriate technology to the end such as "in React component." So "how do I..."

_**Update ref attributes in React components**_ becomes the title of the lesson. This focuses the action on what the viewer should learn, and the title clearly defines the scope for the example you will teach. "I want to...", "can I...", or other phrases would work here too!

Now you want to write a quick summary. Think of the short block of text you see under a link when you are searching on Google. Literally think of that exact box, because the summary is for that space! 2-3 sentences that describe what we will learn in your lesson.

The summary and title aren't set in stone, we can iterate on those too, so don't worry. We aren't striving for perfection.
