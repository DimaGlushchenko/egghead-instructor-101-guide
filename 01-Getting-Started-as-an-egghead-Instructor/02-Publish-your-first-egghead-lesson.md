# Publish your first egghead lesson
There's a chance that you are a seasoned veteran that has recorded many screencasts in the past and will need very little direction to start recording egghead lessons. If that's the case, awesome, but if it isn't, don't worry. We've got your back!

Creating screencasts is hard. It's a learned skill. It can feel weird. You can get the feeling of stage fright sitting in the comfort of your own home office staring at your monitor with nobody else in the room.

The first few lessons can also take a lot of back and forth to get egghead style down. It can be frustrating.

Totally normal!

These feelings *thankfully* fade over time as you learn the skill of creating bite-sized video lessons.

In order to give you an idea of how to build this skill, we are going to take a look at what makes a solid lesson. Later we will talk about these concepts in more depth, so don‚Äôt worry if it doesn‚Äôt click right away.

## Write a lesson title and summary

The first thing we look for is a title and summary for your first lesson. The titles and summaries are super important, and we will hammer on them quite a bit as you get started creating egghead lessons. Armed with a solid title and lesson summary, creating lessons is much more straightforward. It's where we like to start so that you are set up for success straight away.

The first step is to write out a quick summary that explains what the lesson is about. This should be a fairly short paragraph of text that lets the viewer know what concept they will learn in this lesson. 


> In this lesson you will learn how to use the map method from the Lodash library. Map is a powerful tool that can be used to transform collections of data into new collections, without mutating or altering the original data in any way.

With the summary complete, you can write the title. The title is a *summary of the summary**,* and should describe the context of what the viewer is about to learn. Imagine a stack of lesson titles, with thousands of lessons. Each title should let the viewer know what they are about to learn so they can easily decide if this lesson is appropriate for their current goals.

`Transform data collections using Lodash map` 

The title and the summary are what will be displayed in search results, and guide the viewer towards your lessons and courses.

They are very important, but don't worry, we‚Äôre here to help! For your first lesson, we don't want you to worry about perfection or feel like you‚Äôre "spinning your wheels" too much. Just do your best, and we will help you shape your title and summary as needed.

As far as coming up with your first topic goes, just think about something that would be useful to a developer. Think of a tool, a technique, or a practice that you've used in the past. You can also claim a requested lesson in [the egghead Instructor Center.](https://instructor.egghead.io) 

Please note that there is no need to worry about repeating content that might exist on egghead already. We aren't concerned with repetition at all! Often people learning new concepts appreciate seeing the same content taught with multiple approaches.

We also don't worry about pre-requisites--  if we did, every topic would need at least 30 lessons to cover completely. You can start by assuming the viewer has a certain level of knowledge, and the viewer can assume that more lessons will be made later to fill in holes or go into more depth.

The most important thing we like to express to new instructors is:

**Keep the lesson focused on a single concept.** 

We've got plenty of time to explain the rest!

Once you've got a lesson summary and title draft written, share it in Slack in your private instructor channel. We'll give you feedback and ask for changes if any are required.

## Create a code example for the lesson

The example is important, because it is the basis of creating a quality egghead lesson. The example will take the tool or technique you want to demonstrate, and inform the best way to get there.

You will work with your mentor to solidify the theme, scope, and goals of an example. This example will serve as the basis for your first egghead lesson.

When we developed the example lesson title and summary above, we chose a concept that we were going to explain. Your lesson example needs to keep this in mind, and start demonstrating the example code from a state that gets us to the core concept of the lessons.

**There is always more to learn**. Always. We can‚Äôt teach it all, and we especially can‚Äôt teach everything in a single lesson.

At egghead, we strive for *laser focus* on specific concepts. This is what we mean when we say "bite-sized" lessons. We want individual lessons to be as concise and as focused as possible, while showing the viewer all of the steps required.

This means that you should be practical and thorough, respecting the viewers time, as well as your own. For example, we don‚Äôt need to spend several minutes setting up a development environment to demonstrate the concept of Lodash map. 

When coming up with a code example, ask yourself (and discuss with your mentor)


> "Is this example helping to explain the concept?‚Äù

Think of your code example like saying "hey, check this out" to a friend or coworker about some tool, trick, or technique you've used to get the job done. Respect their time and get to the point. Keep it simple, and stick to the concept described in your title and summary.

This is the gold! üí∞

## Now record a rough draft

Imagine that you are sitting next to a coworker, and want to show them a cool new piece of technology that you just learned.

Would you make them a Powerpoint presentation?

Would you read from a script?

Or would you just sit down, fire up a browser and your favorite text editor and actually **show them what you've built**, and why it is interesting?

That's what we are looking for with a draft lesson. You've built a cool example, let's take a look at it. Tell us how you built it, and what makes it interesting.

For now, don't worry about audio or video quality. We will send you professional audio recording gear and explain the technical details about recording screencasts later on.

Make mistakes! This might be new, and screencasting is a learned skill that gets easier with practice. Your video isn't a live presentation, and this draft won't be shared with the world.
Mistakes and restarts are fine. Sometimes we need to cough, kids will run through, train will roll by, you name it, it happens to everybody.

**Just pause for a couple of breaths.**

Pause, and repeat where you were interrupted. Pauses are SO easy to edit out, and you should feel free to use them. 

üî• **Pause a lot.** 

Take a deep breath. Speak with confidence! You *are* the expert. Everyone wants to hear what you have to say.

## Upload Your Lesson

When your draft is complete, upload it to [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lesson_uploads/new). You‚Äôll be able to update the video as edits are made based on the feedback you get. Your mentor knows what we are looking for! Ask your them to screen share with you for the editing process, so that you can get some guidance for the first pass. This can save you **hours** of trying to figure things out. üôÇ 

Once your mentor gives you a thumbs up, you can update your lesson video for final review and publication. 

When you upload any lesson video it is automatically processed to make sure its audio is in stereo, the resolution is as expected, and that it is uploaded to the appropriate storage channels. 

Sometimes this can take a few minutes. If an hour goes by and your lesson video still isn‚Äôt visible, let us know!

## Lesson review and approval

Once the steps above are complete, your lesson is ready to be reviewed for approval. Reviewing means that an experienced egghead instructor will watch your lesson and provide feedback. It‚Äôs not uncommon that your lesson will require a couple of updates. You‚Äôll receive feedback, record the required changes, and replace the lesson‚Äôs video on egghead.

After your lesson has been approved for publishing, it is placed in the lesson publishing queue.

The [lesson publishing queue](https://egghead.io) (visible to instructors that are logged in) automatically publishes lessons from top to bottom. The publishing schedule ranges from daily to a few times per week, depending on how many lessons are in the queue. This way we can ensure that there is a steady flow of new content being released. After publishing, lessons are added to the social media sharing queue, leading to your newly published content being shared across egghead social media accounts. This drives a ton of eyes to your video!
