# Recording and Editing Screencasts
For video capture, on a Mac we can use ScreenFlow, Camtasia, or IShowU HD. On Windows, we stick to Camtasia. There are other tools available for those platforms, but we generally stick to these as they cover most use cases.

# Recording Video

[ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) and Camtasia both provide editing features. We tend to prefer ScreenFlow, and egghead.io instructors are all provided any software licenses you might need.

The decision on which software you use is up to you. Many instructors prefer the standalone simplicity of ScreenFlow.

You can "kick it up a notch BAM!üí•" and move into more sophisticated editing technology with software like Adobe Premiere. Premiere provides some significant advantages, but it also has a steep learning curve. We would recommend starting simple, and leveling-up to a non-linear editing system like Premiere later.

# Capturing Audio Separately

There are effectively three ways that you can record your screencasts.


- Audio First, Video Second
- Video First, Audio Second
- All at once
## ‚ö°Ô∏è all of these approaches are valid.

There are instructors that prefer each of these approaches. All at once is arguably the simplest approach, as you can just type and record the screen and don't have to think about the video and audio separately.
When you record the audio first, you can playback the audio and record video to match. On the flip side, with video recorded first you can narrate over video playback.
It can be challenging to sync and get a natural feeling with narration. Like most things, it takes practice.

# Editing

Editing is a skill. It takes time to become proficient, and it can be tedious until then.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è ripple delete is your greatest ally!

This egghead lesson will show you how you can can edit with ripple delete:

If there is one tool you will use forever when editing video it's ripple delete.

To take full advantage of ripple delete the recommendation we give people is to **record in small sections**. 

Don't try to be Snoop Dogg. *You are not the 1-take dizzle my shizzle*.

Record in "paragraphs" and pause.

This recording in small pieces and pausing is effectively editing while you record.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è record high quality content bites to avoid editing hassles

You want to avoid a situation where you are doing intense editing to move audio and video snippets around to build a quilt like final product. **This** is the most tedious thing you could do to yourself, so by recording in small paragraph bites, you can get better takes, and by pausing in between each section, you can see visibly where you need to **ripple delete** and build your final product with minimal aggravation!

Here‚Äôs an egghead lesson that will show you how you can record in "chunks":

You do want to go back and make sure you edit out mouth noises and excessive "um"s. If you find yourself having to edit these out, it might take some pre-thought to avoid including them in the first place.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è the easiest way to edit is to capture it well

In traditional videography this is often referred to as ‚Äúin camera editing‚Äù which means that we are capturing content that doesn‚Äôt need to be edited much at all. 

This takes practice. You‚Äôll get better and better as you record more screencast lessons.

The first handful of lessons feel like a major effort to produce because you have to consider so many different things. You are teaching complex concepts and learning complex concepts at the same time.
