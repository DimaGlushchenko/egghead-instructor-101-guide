## Creating Courses

Courses are what people truly love to watch. Humans desire information in chunks. They want to learn a topic in depth, but at a pace that works for them.

For egghead, courses are the natural extension of the individual lesson. A course is a composed set of bite-sized lessons. The course itself should be bite-sized, covering a single topic in depth through a sequence of individual lessons. Within a course, each individual lesson should be as autonomous as possible, covering its own individual topic as independently from the other lessons in the course.

## Course Styles

egghead.io courses have several styles. The most important aspects of a course are focus and high quality examples. If you have those two things, the style doesn't matter. It definitely helps to have a plan though, and the following are excellent places to start.

* **Documentation**: This is straight forward presentation of the documentation for a library, framework, or tool. Dan Abramov's [popular course on Redux is a good example of this](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux). This doesn't mean you should simply read the docs to the student. Instead take the docs and present them with high quality examples.

* **Project Based**: Another favorite is a project based approach. In this case we start with a project that the student will build from start to finish. John Lindquist has [done this with his Time Machine example app](https://egghead.io/courses/building-a-time-machine-with-angular-2-and-rxjs) using Angualr 2 and ngrx\/store.

* **Cookbook**: You can also present a series of problems and solutions in the "cookbook" style. A typical recipe will include some common \(or maybe not so common\) problem, and then provide an example solution for the problem using the tool the cookbook is discussing. Trevor D. Miller's [React Testing Cookbook](https://egghead.io/courses/react-testing-cookbook) is a solid example of this approach.


## The Course Proposal

For every egghead course we request (and require) a written proposal before the course starts production. We ask for proposals for several reasons. To make sure a course is solid, and delivers a ton of value to your students making the proposal lets us think more deeply about the content and structure of the course. This approach allows us to define the intent of the course, as well as craft [great titles](/02-creating-lessons/ideas.md) for the course and its lessons.

[Here is an example of a course proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1goXtI_zmSfXTgaimrxIss356DoedPRt5MMAySs1f-bE/edit), and here's [a blank template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5_UehD9mM2jeCtlqEZFy3epDLLmbgBBGCow5fDRNCc/edit#) for you to use.

The proposal consists of 4 parts:

* User Story
* Goals
* Summary
* List of Lessons

We'll take a look at each of these parts in more detail.

### The User Story

At the top of the course proposal is a "user story". This is similar to the agile software practice of writing a story to describe **who**, **what**, and **why** we are creating this thing.

> As a _developer_, I want to build applications with React and Redux so that I can create applications that aren't littered with state.

### Goals

The second section of the course proposal consists of a list of goals for the course. What are we trying to teach? Why are we teaching it? What knowledge should the student walk away with?

### Summary

The course summary is a paragraph or two that describes the course, goals, technology, etc. This will generally be preseneted with the course on the website, so it should keep that in mind.

### Lesson List

Finally, we have the actual list of lessons that will be in the course. The list consists of **lesson titles and summaries** for each individual lesson. The title should follow [the "how do I..." format](/how-do-i), and the summary should summarize the goals and technology that the student will learn about in the lesson.

## Recording the Course

With the prep you've done above, a lot of the hard work is done for creating a course. You can iterate on paper and build a solid curriculmn that will be useful for thousands of developers for years to come. Once your proposal has been approved, you can start recording the lessons and uploading them as you finished.

It isn't required that you record and finish all of the lessons in a specific period of time. It can take quite some time to create a full course, so just get them done as you can.

You can read [the section on creating lessons](/02-creating-lessons/create-lessons.md) to get more details on that.
