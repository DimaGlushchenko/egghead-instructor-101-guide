## Creating Courses

Now that you've had a lesson or two published, you might be thinking "I really want to create a course!"

This is great, and we are going to help you do just that.

### Course Ideas

We want to provide some "food for thought" around what makes an interesting course. 

### Course Planning

A course is coupled with a written proposal in [this format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1goXtI_zmSfXTgaimrxIss356DoedPRt5MMAySs1f-bE/edit).

The course proposal should have a "user story" sentence that describes who the user is, what they want to learn, and why they want to learn it.

It should have a "goals" section that clearly defines the learning objectives for the course.

It should have a summary that describes in narrative form what it is we will be learning. 

It should have a list of lesson titles and short summaries for the proposed lessons. Titles should be descriptive and contain the key words for the lesson topic. Often using "how do I" in front of the title helps here.

### Creating Examples

Good lessons have good examples. We want to show the user a series of small, high-quality examples that serve the goal of the course. We are all here for the code, so lets deliver.

### Recording Lessons
